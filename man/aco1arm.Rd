\title{A function to estimate parameters in augmented case-only designs, the genotype is ascertained for a random subcohort from the active treatment arm or the placebo arm
}
\description{
This function estimates parameters of proportional hazards model with gene-treatment interaction. It employs case-cohort estimation incorporating the case-only estimators. The method was published in Dai et al. (2015) Biometrics.

\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A data frame used to access the following data.
}
  \item{svtime}{
A character string of column name, corresponds to one column of the data frame, which is used to store the failure time variable (numeric). 
}
  \item{event}{
A character string of column name, corresponds to one column of the data frame,which is used to store the indicator of failure event (1: failure, 0: not failure).
}
  \item{treatment}{
A character string of column name, corresponds to one column of the data frame, which is used to store the binary vector of treatment variable (1: treatment, 0: placebo). 
}
  \item{BaselineMarker}{
A character string of column name, corresponds to one column of the data frame, which is used to store a vector of biomarker. 
}
  \item{id}{
A character string of column name, corresponds to one column of the data frame, which is used to store the sample identifier.
}
  \item{subcohort}{
A character string of column name, corresponds to one column of the data frame, which is used to store the indicator of sub-cohort (1: sample belong to the sub-cohort, 0: not belong to the sub-cohort)
}
  \item{esttype}{
The option of estimation methods (1: Self-Prentice estimator, 0: Lin-Ying estimator).
}
  \item{augment}{
The indicator of whether subcohort was drawn from the active treatment arm (augment=1) or from the placebo arm (augment=0).
}
  \item{extra}{
A string vector of column name(s), corresponds to more or more column(s) of the data frame, which is/are used to store the extra baseline covariate(s) to be adjusted for in addition to treatment and biomarker.
}
}
\details{
The function returns estimates of the proportional hazards model, and variance of the estimates. The method was published in Dai et al. (2015) Biometrics.
