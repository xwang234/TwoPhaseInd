	Abstract = {Recent results for case-control sampling suggest when the covariate distribution is constrained by gene-environment independence, semiparametric estimation exploiting such independence yields a great deal of efficiency gain. We consider the efficient estimation of the treatment-biomarker interaction in two-phase sampling nested within randomized clinical trials, incorporating the independence between a randomized treatment and the baseline markers. We develop a Newton-Raphson algorithm based on the profile likelihood to compute the semiparametric maximum likelihood estimate (SPMLE). Our algorithm accommodates both continuous phase-one outcomes and continuous phase-two biomarkers. The profile information matrix is computed explicitly via numerical differentiation. In certain situations where computing the SPMLE is slow, we propose a maximum estimated likelihood estimator (MELE), which is also capable of incorporating the covariate independence. This estimated likelihood approach uses a one-step empirical covariate distribution, thus is straightforward to maximize. It offers a closed-form variance estimate with limited increase in variance relative to the fully efficient SPMLE. Our results suggest exploiting the covariate independence in two-phase sampling increases the efficiency substantially, particularly for estimating treatment-biomarker interactions.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Women's Health Initiative hormone trials identified a 44% increase in ischemic stroke risk with combination estrogen plus progestin and a 39% increase with estrogen alone. We undertook a case-control biomarker study to elucidate underlying mechanisms, and to potentially identify women who would be at lower or higher risk for stroke with postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT). DESIGN: The hormone trials were randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled. SETTING: The Women's Health Initiative trials were conducted at 40 clinical centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: The trials enrolled 27,347 postmenopausal women, aged 50-79 y. INTERVENTIONS: We randomized 16,608 women with intact uterus to conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg with medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg daily or placebo, and 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy to conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg daily or placebo. OUTCOME MEASURES: Stroke was ascertained during 5.6 y of follow-up in the estrogen plus progestin trial and 6.8 y of follow-up in the estrogen alone trial. RESULTS: No baseline clinical characteristics, including gene polymorphisms, identified women for whom the stroke risk from HT was higher. Paradoxically, women with higher baseline levels of some stroke-associated biomarkers had a lower risk of stroke when assigned to estrogen plus progestin compared to placebo. For example, those with higher IL-6 were not at increased stroke risk when assigned to estrogen plus progestin (odds ratio 1.28) but were when assigned to placebo (odds ratio 3.47; p for difference = 0.02). Similar findings occurred for high baseline PAP, leukocyte count, and D-dimer. However, only an interaction of D-dimer during follow-up interaction with HT and stroke was marginally significant (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers did not identify women at higher stroke risk with postmenopausal HT. Some biomarkers appeared to identify women at lower stroke risk with estrogen plus progestin, but these findings may be due to chance.},
